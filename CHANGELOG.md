## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2022-11-14
### Changed
- 2.0.0 introduced a function, `calculate`, which returned a `u64`. This is incorrect, because:
  - The hash algorithm calculates two values, `left` and `right`;
  - Records in a BSA archive are sorted by hash, `left` being more significant than `right` (i.e.
    a possible `u64` representation would cast `left`, a 32-bit value, to a `u64` and shift it left
    by 32 bits);
  - However, the hash values are stored as two 32-bit little-endian integers, not one 64-bit
    integer (i.e. `left` appears before `right`);
  - So the function doesn't make any sense. ðŸ˜…
  This function has been removed, and `calculate_tuple` has been renamed to `calculate`. Apologies
  for the chaos.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-11-12
### Changed
- Backwards-incompatible changes have been introduced to the API. Now it consists of two functions:
  - `calculate` - returns a `u64`
  - `calculate_tuple` - returns a `(u32, u32)`, similar to `calculate` in 1.0.x
  Unlike 1.0.x, these functions are not generic. This enables upgrading them to `const fn` in a
  future release, without breaking the API (again).

## [1.0.2] - 2019-08-29
### Changed
- Updated criterion to 0.3. (No code changes were necessary in order to support this.)
- The changelog now conforms to [Keep a Changelog] format. It has been renamed from `CHANGES.md` to
  `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.0.1] - 2019-05-26
### Added
- Changes are now recorded in `CHANGES.md`.

### Changed
- Refactored for increased performance.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-05-26
### Added
- Initial release.
